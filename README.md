# Case-of-Study---Office-Supplies
Case of Study of a Pens &amp; Printers Enterprise about their sales.
Project first developed in DataCamp repository with Python and the presentation was created with KeyNotes and exported to PowerPoint.

#Pens & Printers is a national office supplies chain. 
#They have just reported a 23% drop in revenue in the past year. 
#At the moment, they send office supplies out of warehouses in four regions: 
#East, West, South, and Central, and all four warehouses stock the same products. 
#The Head of Sales thinks this leads to large amounts of unsold products in some locations.
#The management at Pens & Printers would like you to look at the data and present to them 
#the popularity of products in each region. Are there products that do not sell in some locations? 
#Are there any other patterns over time in each region that you can find in the data?
#Your presentation should be no longer than ten minutes. It should include no more than eight slides of content. 
#You will be presenting to the Head of Sales.
